# TriggerMe C# Request Library
C# Library to make requests to the TriggerMe Forwarder/Router. TriggerMe provides an API proxy to Test, Forward and Route requests.

TriggerMe provides a serverless proxy to help diagnose API request issues, manage retries and mock responses. 

# Usage
To forward a HTTP Post request:

```csharp
var content = new { message = "Hello World" };
var strContent = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(content), Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

Options.ApiKey = "[[Your API Key]]";
var client = new ForwardRequestClient();
var response = await client.PostAsync("[[TargetUrl]]", strContent);
Console.WriteLine(response.RequestId);
```

You can check the status of the request using the `RequestId` returned from the response object.

```csharp
var requestStatus = new ForwardRequestStatus();
var update = await requestStatus.CheckRequestAsync(response.RequestId);
Console.WriteLine(update.Result);
```

You can download the Request or Response body by accessing the `BlobUri` property of either `RequestLog.BlobUri` or `RequestLog.RetryRecords[].BlobUri`.

***Note:** These Blob URIs are timed so should not be cached*

```csharp
// Downloading the request blob
var req = await update.Request.DownloadBlobAsStringAsync();
Console.WriteLine(req);

// Downloading the final response blob
var response = await update.RetryRecords.Last().DownloadBlobAsStringAsync();
Console.WriteLine(response);
```
